# React Store Frontend

The React Store Frontend is a React-based web application designed to meet the objectives of my INF 655, Front-End Web Development Midterm. 

This (mock) application allows users to browse, search for, and purchase fitness equipment, as well as manage their shopping cart.

## Features

- **Product Browsing**: Users can view a list of available fitness equipment on the home page, with a featured product highlighted.
- **Search Functionality**: A search feature allows users to find products by name across the store's inventory.
- **Product Details**: Users can view detailed information about each product by navigating to the product's detail page.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart, view the cart's contents, adjust quantities, remove items, or clear the cart entirely.
- **Checkout Process**: A simple checkout process collects basic shipping information and provides an order summary before submission.

## Setup Instructions
